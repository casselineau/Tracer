Tracer - a Pythonic general ray-tracing package.

About
-----
Tracer is a ray-tracing engine and suite of tools focused on radiative heat transfer and optical simulations.

The motivation for writing tracer:
* Current solutions lack programmability and extensibility
* Even if you pay megabucks
* De-facto standard tools of the trade are non-free, so bugfixing
  etc. depends on someone else,
* Usability in the solution closest to our budget is poor, and no Linux
  port is available.

Tracer is written in Python, using NumPy and SciPy for the math side of things.

Status
------
The code is advanced enough to produce research. It is currently a programming
library. NO GUI yet.

DISCLAIMER: The documentation and installation is outdated, but he project is active! Doubts, need advice?: charlesalexis.asselineau@ump.es

Current capablilities:
- Flat, parabolic, spherical, conical and quadric surfaces
- Specular and diffuse reflections with surface slope error
- BDRF
- Transparency and attenuation
- A bunch of results analysis tools
- Pillbox and Buie sunshape implementations
- Radiosity sytem solver for thermal emissions
- Basic parallel processing
- Kd-Tree acceleration structure
- Spectral simulations

Open-source python magic happens: if you want to do something, you can do it.

Installation
------------
LINUX:
To install Tracer on your system, run the following from the command line from your downloaded Tracer directory:

  python3 setup.py install

Before installing, make sure that the following dependencies are installed:
